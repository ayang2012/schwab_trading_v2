# Testing Framework Summary

## Overview
The Schwab Trading V2 system now includes comprehensive testing to ensure data accuracy, real-time updates, and proper calculations.

## Test Files

### 1. `tests/test_data_validation.py`
**Purpose**: Validate real-time data accuracy and calculation bounds

**Key Tests**:
- `test_data_freshness()`: Ensures timestamps differ between API calls (real-time data)
- `test_short_options_pnl_bounds()`: **Critical** - Verifies short option P&L never exceeds 100% (can't collect more than premium)
- `test_technical_indicators_reasonableness()`: Validates RSI (0-100), positive MAs, reasonable Bollinger bands
- `test_account_value_consistency()`: Checks account values are reasonable and position calculations accurate
- `test_cash_secured_put_collateral_calculation()`: Verifies cash secured put collateral math
- `test_multiple_runs_consistency()`: Ensures consistent results across multiple quick runs

### 2. `validate.py`
**Purpose**: Quick validation script for regular monitoring

**Features**:
- Fast validation of key metrics
- P&L bounds checking for short options
- Technical indicator sanity checks
- Account value reasonableness validation
- Cash secured put collateral verification

### 3. `test_realtime.py`
**Purpose**: Verify real-time market data changes

**Features**:
- Collects multiple data samples over time
- Analyzes price movements to confirm live data
- Detects stale data issues
- Market hours awareness

## Running Tests

### All Automated Tests (Excludes Integration)
```bash
pytest tests/ -v -m "not integration"
```

### Data Validation Tests Only
```bash
pytest tests/test_data_validation.py -v
```

### Quick Validation (Anytime)
```bash
python3.11 validate.py
```

### Real-Time Data Test
```bash
python3.11 test_realtime.py
```

### Integration Tests (Manual)
```bash
pytest tests/ -v -m "integration"
```

## Key Validations

### âœ… P&L Bounds Protection
- **Critical**: Short options P&L cannot exceed 100%
- Validates both position data and technical analysis calculations
- Prevents impossible profit scenarios

### âœ… Real-Time Data Verification
- Confirms timestamps change between calls
- Detects price movements in stocks and options
- Account values update with market movements

### âœ… Technical Indicator Validation
- RSI within 0-100 range
- Moving averages are positive and reasonable
- Bollinger bands properly ordered
- Support/resistance levels sensible

### âœ… Financial Calculation Accuracy
- Market value = qty Ã— price (within tolerance)
- Cash secured put collateral calculated correctly
- Account totals reasonable and consistent

## Usage Examples

### Daily Validation
```bash
# Quick check - run before market opens
python3.11 validate.py

# Comprehensive validation during market hours
pytest tests/test_data_validation.py -v
```

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Test data freshness during market hours
python3.11 test_realtime.py

# Monitor for anomalies in P&L calculations
python3.11 validate.py && echo "All validations passed"
```

### Development Testing
```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest tests/ -v -m "not integration"

# Test specific functionality
pytest tests/test_data_validation.py::TestDataValidation::test_short_options_pnl_bounds -v
```

## Expected Results

### Current System Status âœ…
- **18 automated tests**: All passing
- **Real-time data**: Confirmed working (prices change every 5-10 seconds)
- **P&L calculations**: Proper bounds (-5.5% to 33.3% observed)
- **Technical indicators**: All within reasonable ranges
- **Account values**: Consistent and reasonable ($356k range)
- **Cash secured put collateral**: $10,450 calculated correctly

### Test Output Samples
```
âœ… All short option P&L values within bounds (â‰¤100%)
âœ… All technical indicators within reasonable ranges  
âœ… Account value reasonable: $356,313.43
âœ… Cash secured put collateral: $10,450.00
ðŸŽ‰ All validations passed!
```

## Integration with Live Trading

These tests provide a foundation for live trading systems by ensuring:

1. **Data Quality**: Real-time, accurate market data
2. **Risk Management**: P&L bounds prevent calculation errors
3. **System Reliability**: Consistent behavior across multiple runs
4. **Market Awareness**: Proper handling of market hours and data freshness

The testing framework automatically validates the core assumptions required for automated trading decisions.
